Little Ruby Codes is a project to teach introductory learners core ideas to software development in a fun and simple manner.

The idea is to transform a simple and familiar story, which starts as a series of `puts`, into an increasingly dynamic system by adding variables, control structures, classes and more.

Using the classic story of "Little Red Riding Hood" gives the learner a consistent and simple foundation in which to add concepts.

It will also be an introduction to some simple software workflows, like git and commandline execution.

There will be an accompanying website at http://littleruby.codes/ (a new tld) that can be used through self learning or as a presentation

The base story is the Charles Perrault version, taken from The University of Pittsburgh website >> http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type0333.html

This is hopefully the first of many "Object Orientated Stories" (OOStories or 'Double O Stories') to translate abstract literature ideas to code. However it will remain the central one for communicating ideas in the Ruby language. I have a post written about the idea here: http://caseypatrickdriscoll.com/ideas/object-orientated-stories/


Chapter 0 - Hello, World
	- Install vagrant and ubuntu
	- Install github app
	- ssh into vm
	- Create helloworld.rb
	- Successfully run on command line

	- Optionally, install iTerm/Sublime
	- Optionally, install and run watchr
	- Optionally, install pry and rbenv; discuss gems

Chapter 1 - Puts the story

	- Optionally, add code to save output to file

Chapter 2 - Variables
	- Philosophy of DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
		+ Walk through code, show parts that are repeated, especially character names
	- Declaring and creating an instance variable
		+ Create character variables and assign: @hero, @villain, @victim
	- Concatenating Strings and interpolation
		+ Insert @hero, @villain, @victim
	- Overwriting variables and namespace
		+ Change name of @villain and @victim by creating second assignment line

		+ Add @hero_trait_1 for @hero
		+ Add plot points with @intro, @ending, @does_a_weird_thing, @door_noise, @door_instructions
	- Discuss .downcase and .upcase
		+ Change pertinent @victim calls to downcase
		+ Change @door_noise to upcase
	- Prelude to containers
		+ Add @item_ variables
		+ Add @villain_trait_ variables

	- Optionally, discuss variable scope
	- Optionally, discuss types of variables

Chapter 3 - Arrays and Hashes
