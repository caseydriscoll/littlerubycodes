Little Ruby Codes is a project to teach introductory learners core ideas to software development in a fun and simple manner.

The idea is to transform a simple and familiar story, which starts as a series of `puts`, into an increasingly dynamic system by adding variables, control structures, classes and possibly more.

Using the classic story of "Little Red Riding Hood" gives the learner a consistent and simple foundation in which to add concepts.

It will also be an introduction to some simple software workflows, like git and commandline execution.

There will be an accompanying website at http://littleruby.codes (a new tld) that can be used through self learning or presentation

The base story is the Charles Perrault version, taken from The University of Pittsburgh website >> http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type0333.html

This is hopefully the first of many "Object Orientated Stories" (OOStories or 'Double O Stories') to translate abstract literature ideas to code. However it will remain the central one for communicating ideas in the Ruby language. I have a post written about the idea here: http://caseypatrickdriscoll.com/ideas/object-orientated-stories/
